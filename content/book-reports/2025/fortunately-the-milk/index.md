## What Happened
Children want cereal for breakfast.  The type of cereal is Toastios.  But they do not have milk!  The children want milk.  Their father wants milk in his tea.  So, he goes to the corner shop.  It took longer than usual because he went on a _big_ adventure!

First, a flying disc came over him.  He said, "_Hello_, that's not something you see every day!"  Then it took him into the disc.  It was a spaceship!  There were aliens inside!

He went out the emergency exit and landed in the sea.  Then a pirate took him!  He went to the pirate queen.  The pirate queen put him on a diving board.  A hot air balloon saved him!  

He even goes on a volcano adventure!  The volcano was carved with a face.  It looked angry on the picture.  There was a green gem stone I think on the volcano.

Professor Steg pressed the time machine again.  Then they went back into their home pasture.  

_The aliens came again!_  And the pirates.  Dinosaur police came, I think.  The children's father had 2 milk bottles.  When he ran back to the hot air balloon, the 2 milk bottles touched everybody thought the whole universe would end.  It did not end!

## I liked this book because
