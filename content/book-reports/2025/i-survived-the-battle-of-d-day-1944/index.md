## What Happened
It's about a boy named Paul surviving the Battle of D-Day. D-Day is basically the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Paul got wrapped in the head by a rock. It knocked him into a decent sleep. He could not wake up. When he woke up, the battle was still going. He ran away to his tower. 

They spun a bicycle wheel to power a radio 3 days later.
