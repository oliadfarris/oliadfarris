## What Happened
So, the book is about the same character in Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Wrecking Ball, which is Greg.

The beginning is when Greg plays with a doll.  It kind of looks realistic.  It also eats.  I don't know how it eats.  There is also Santa scout.  Santa scout is Greg's mother's doll when she was Greg's age (I think).  Santa Scout watches Greg which annoys him!  He like freaks out when that happens!

In the middle of the book, it's kind of crazy at Greg's school.  All the play equipment is _gone_!  😮 Some students sit on the playground which is not ok with the teachers.  The teachers cannot touch kids. 😮

At the end, it is Christmas.  Greg or anyone in the family does not have presents! 😮 Santa got in a blizzard.  That's why he couldn't reach the presents.  So, mom had to make the presents.

## I liked this book because
I liked Santa Scout because he looks cool.  He looks like Santa and a skeleton a little bit.  It made me feel excited!  😇
